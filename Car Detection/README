# Car Detection

## Overview

Car Detection is a TensorFlow-based project designed to identify cars within images and draw bounding boxes around them. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to train a model on a dataset of car images, enabling accurate detection of cars in various scenarios.

## Features

- **Car Detection:** Automatically identifies cars within images.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Draws bounding boxes around detected cars for easy visualization.
- **Flexible Deployment:** The trained model can be integrated into existing systems or used as a standalone application for car detection tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset contains images with labeled bounding boxes around cars.

2. Train the model: Run the training script to train the car detection model on your dataset.

3. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics.

4. Run inference: Apply the trained model to detect cars in new images.
